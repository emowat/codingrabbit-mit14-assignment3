# Assignment 3: Effective Programming in C and C++

Welcome to Assignment 3! 

This repository is fully configured with a GitHub Codespace environment. You do not need to install anything on your computer to complete this assignment—all coding, compiling, and testing can be done directly in your web browser.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if not already done)
To use GitHub Codespaces, you must have a GitHub account. If you do not have one:
1. Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and create a free account.
2. Make sure you are logged in before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 1: Launch Your Environment
1. Go to [www.codingrabbit.dev](https://www.codingrabbit.dev) and sign in with the email address and password assigned to you.
2. On the left tab, click **Codespace Launch**.
3. Find your section and click **Launch Codespace**.
4. At that point, you will be asked to sign into GitHub.
5. A new browser tab will open with a web-based version of VS Code. Please wait a minute or two for the environment to build.

## Step 2: Sign into Coding Rabbit
Our custom AI Teaching Assistant, **CodingRabbit**, is pre-installed in your environment to help you learn! 
1. Click **Sign In**. This will securely open a *new browser tab* and ask you to log into the course platform.
2. After logging in successfully, the page will display your temporary authorization code. Click the **Copy** button on the screen.
3. Switch back to your original **VS Code browser tab** and **Paste** the code into the prompt window at the top center of the screen to finish signing in.
4. You can now use CodingRabbit for **Homework Assist** (to debug your current code) or **Study Assist** (to explain complex concepts)!

## Step 3: Review Coding Examples from Lecture 6
Inside this repository, you will find the folder `lecture-06-examples`.
Review the code in these examples to refresh your memory, and be sure to ask CodingRabbit if you have any questions about how they work!

## Step 4: Start Your Assignment
Inside this repository, you will find 3 problem folders:
* `problem1/` - Linked List Manipulation (Refactor)

Each folder contains an `Instructions.pdf` and a starter `.cpp` or `.c` file. 
1. Use the **Explorer** icon (the file folders on the top left of your sidebar) to navigate into a problem directory.
2. Click on the `.cpp` file (e.g., `list.cpp`) to open it in your editor and begin working!
3. Compile and test your code using the terminal at the bottom of the screen.
4. Click on the **Coding Rabbit** icon on the left of the screen anytime you need
   help.

## Step 5: Shutting Down (Important!)
GitHub gives you a limited number of free compute hours per month for Codespaces. If you simply close your browser tab, the Codespace stays running in the background for 30 minutes before timing out, draining your free hours!

When you are done working for the day, **always stop your Codespace**:
1. Open the VS Code Command Palette by pressing **`F1`** (or click the gear icon in the bottom left -> Command Palette).
2. Type **`Codespaces: Stop Current Codespace`** and hit Enter.
3. You can safely close the tab once the session ends.

*(Alternatively, you can manage and stop your active environments at [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces))*

## Step 6: Saving & Submitting Your Work
Because you launched your Codespace from a template directly, your work is currently saved in an isolated, unpublished local repository inside the Codespace container. 

### How to Save Files
By default, VS Code will often auto-save your files. However, you can manually save any file by pressing **`Ctrl + S`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd + S`** (Mac) on your keyboard, or by clicking **File > Save** in the top menu bar.

### How to Submit (VS Code Method)
To safely back up your code to a private repository on your GitHub account and submit your assignment:
1. Open the **Source Control** panel (the Git icon on the left sidebar in VS Code).
2. Hover over the word **Changes** and click the **`+`** icon to stage all your changed files.
3. Type a message in the text box (like "Finished assignment") and click the **Commit** button.
4. Finally, click the large blue **Publish Branch** button.
5. VS Code will prompt you to publish to a private repository on your GitHub account. Follow the prompts to confirm.

### How to Submit (Terminal Method - Optional)
If you prefer using the command line, you can achieve the exact same result by running these commands in the terminal at the bottom of the screen:
1. `git add .` *(stages all your changed files)*
2. `git commit -m "Finished assignment"` *(saves the changes to history)*
3. `git push` *(VS Code will intercept this and ask if you want to publish the branch to a private repo)*

Your code is now safely backed up and visible in your new private GitHub repository!
